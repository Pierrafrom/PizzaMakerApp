**controller**: User action handling classes.
**main**: Main class launching the application.
**model**: Data structuring classes.
**style**: Graphic elements of the user interface.
**utils**: Utility functions.
**view**: Elements visible to the user.
This structure makes the project modular, maintainable, and scalable.

### Management of Libraries and Dependencies
